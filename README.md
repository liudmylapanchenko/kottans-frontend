## Git Basics  
Previously I passed a Git course from Udacity so it was easy to pass this one from Coursera. It helped me to refresh my knowledge in Git because i didn't use it since passing the previous one. Also, from this course I learned new information about diff and patch.
After that I consolidated my knowledge with Learn Git Branching course. It was really interesting and even fun to pass every stage :smiley:
