### Git Basics  
Previously passed a course from Udacity so it was easy to pass this one from Coursera. Also, it helped me to refresh my knowledge in Git because i didn't use it since passing the previous one.  
After that I consolidated my knowledge with Learn Git Branching course. It was really interesting and even fun to pass every stage :smiley:
